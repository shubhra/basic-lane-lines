### **Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road using Python and OpenCV

My pipeline consists of the following steps-
1. Convert the image to grayscale

2. Clean up the image by applying a Gaussian Blur which removes noise and
smooths out tiny details in the image:

3. Run Canny Edge Detection to detect edges in the above blurred image using
intensity variation:

4. Setup vertices for a region of interest in the lower half of the image and eliminate
edges from the previous step that are outside this region of interest:

5. Use HoughLines algorithm to find all lines passing through the edge points that
we got in the previous step

6. Modify the draw_lines function to consider only those lines that are not too
vertical or too horizontal as these would not be valid in case of lane lines. Also
group the lines (and their centers) into left and right lanes based on their slope.
Calculate the average slopes and centers for the left and right groups of lines.
Based on the center and slope calculate left line and right line end bottom points
assuming one of the end-points for each will cross the bottom of the image.
Similarly calculate the top endpoints by extrapolating the bottom and center
points.

7. Run region of interest again to limit the extrapolated lines calculated in the
previous step:

8. Overlay the lines on the original image as final output:

### Potential shortcomings with the current pipeline
One potential shortcoming as seen in the [challenge](./test_videos_output/challenge.mp4) video is that extreme
variations in the light can cause the line detection to not work correctly. It can end up
detecting dark shadows on the road from trees, lane separators etc. as lines. Secondly,
the road has patchy segments the line detection incorrectly detects lanes in those
patches. Thirdly, if there lane lines on the road have faded or the color of lane lines is
not too different from the road itself even then the pipeline doesnâ€™t work well. A couple
failure example:
![alt text][imagefail-1]
![alt text][imagefail-2]

### Possible improvements to the pipeline
A possible improvement would be to somehow use color information as an
intermediate step to help supplement the edge and line detection algorithms. Another
improvement could be use some grouping algorithm that can detect outliers from the left
and right lines and then ignore those outliers.
